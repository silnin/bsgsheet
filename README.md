# Project bsgsheet: https://github.com/silnin/bsgsheet
2015-04-05: This personal project should provide functionality to host a platform where users can create and maintain their tabletop Battlestar Galactica RPG character sheets

Currently, it contains nothing more than a barebore Symfony2, doctrine and FOSuser setup, and a Vagrantfile.
